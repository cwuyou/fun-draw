## Detailed Validation Results

### 1. Visual Hierarchy and Information Clarity

#### ✅ Test Results: PASSED (100% success rate)

**Key Findings:**
- Clear visual hierarchy maintained across all device types
- Essential information (draw quantity, list count, game status) prominently displayed
- Non-essential information (remaining cards) appropriately de-emphasized
- Consistent information density optimization for mobile devices

**Specific Validations:**

| Device Type | Visual Order | Information Clarity | Mobile Optimization |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Mobile      | ✅ Correct   | ✅ Clear          | ✅ Optimized      |
| Tablet      | ✅ Correct   | ✅ Clear          | ✅ Appropriate    |
| Desktop     | ✅ Correct   | ✅ Clear          | ✅ Full Detail    |

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// Test validation confirms proper hierarchy
const gameInfoRect = gameInfo.getBoundingClientRect()
const cardAreaRect = cardArea.getBoundingClientRect()
const startButtonRect = startButton.getBoundingClientRect()

expect(gameInfoRect.bottom).toBeLessThan(cardAreaRect.top) // ✅
expect(cardAreaRect.bottom).toBeLessThan(startButtonRect.top) // ✅
```
