# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the card flip lottery game where cards overflow container boundaries and dealing fails completely in certain scenarios. The problems affect multiple card counts and become progressively worse with higher quantities:

1. **Multi-row overflow issue**: When card count > 3, cards are arranged in multiple rows, but the second row consistently overflows the container bottom boundary (affects 4, 5, 6+ cards)
2. **Function reference error**: `adaptiveCardAreaSpacing` function doesn't exist, causing "TypeError: __webpack_require__(...).adaptiveCardAreaSpacing is not a function"
3. **Dealing failure for 7+ cards**: When quantity > 7, the dealing animation gets stuck and fails with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'x')"
4. **Position calculation cascade failure**: The missing function causes the entire position calculation chain to fail, resulting in undefined positions

These issues break the core game functionality and make the lottery system unusable for common scenarios (5-6 cards) and completely broken for larger quantities (7+ cards).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user playing the card lottery game, I want all 6 cards to be visible and properly positioned within the game container, so that I can see and interact with every card during the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 6 cards are dealt THEN all cards SHALL be positioned within the visible container boundaries
2. WHEN the game container has limited space THEN the card layout SHALL automatically adjust to fit all cards
3. WHEN cards are positioned THEN no card SHALL extend beyond the container edges (left, right, top, bottom)
4. WHEN the layout calculation completes THEN all card positions SHALL be validated against container dimensions
5. WHEN container space is insufficient THEN the system SHALL apply size reduction before positioning cards

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user on different screen sizes, I want the card layout to adapt intelligently to my screen dimensions, so that cards are always visible regardless of my device or window size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container width is narrow THEN cards SHALL be arranged in fewer columns with appropriate spacing
2. WHEN the container height is limited THEN card size SHALL be reduced to fit within available space
3. WHEN screen space is very constrained THEN the system SHALL use compact layout with minimal spacing
4. WHEN layout adaptation occurs THEN card readability SHALL be maintained with minimum size thresholds
5. WHEN adaptive layout is applied THEN the system SHALL log the adaptation reason for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging layout issues, I want comprehensive position validation and boundary checking, so that I can quickly identify and fix positioning problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN card positions are calculated THEN each position SHALL be validated against container boundaries
2. WHEN a position exceeds container bounds THEN the system SHALL log the violation with specific coordinates
3. WHEN position validation fails THEN the system SHALL apply corrective adjustments automatically
4. WHEN boundary violations occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error context including container size and card dimensions
5. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL display visual indicators for container boundaries and card positions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user experiencing position calculation errors, I want the system to recover gracefully with fallback positioning, so that the game remains playable even when layout calculations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN position calculation throws an error THEN the system SHALL catch the error and apply safe fallback positions
2. WHEN fallback positioning is used THEN all cards SHALL still be visible and interactive
3. WHEN the `adaptiveCardAreaSpacing` function is missing THEN the system SHALL use built-in spacing calculations
4. WHEN layout calculation fails completely THEN the system SHALL use a simple grid layout as emergency fallback
5. WHEN fallback is applied THEN the user SHALL be notified through console warnings but game functionality SHALL continue

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user playing with 6 cards specifically, I want the layout to be optimized for this common use case, so that the cards are well-distributed and easy to interact with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exactly 6 cards are dealt THEN they SHALL be arranged in an optimal 2x3 or 3x2 grid based on container aspect ratio
2. WHEN 6 cards are positioned THEN spacing between cards SHALL be consistent and visually pleasing
3. WHEN the 6-card layout is calculated THEN it SHALL prioritize balanced distribution over maximum card size
4. WHEN container allows THEN 6 cards SHALL be arranged in a single row if space permits
5. WHEN 6-card layout is applied THEN the total layout SHALL not exceed 80% of container width and height

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user playing with any number of cards from 4-10, I want all cards to be properly positioned without overflow, so that I can see and interact with every card regardless of the quantity I choose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 4 or 5 cards are dealt THEN the second row SHALL NOT overflow the container bottom boundary
2. WHEN cards are arranged in multiple rows THEN each row SHALL be positioned within the visible container area
3. WHEN card count is between 4-10 THEN the multi-row layout SHALL automatically adjust spacing to prevent overflow
4. WHEN the second row is created THEN it SHALL have sufficient vertical space within the container
5. WHEN multi-row layout is applied THEN row spacing SHALL be calculated to fit all rows within available height

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user trying to deal 7 or more cards, I want the dealing animation to complete successfully, so that I can play the lottery game with larger quantities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quantity is set to 7 or more cards THEN the dealing animation SHALL complete without getting stuck
2. WHEN dealing 7+ cards THEN all card positions SHALL be calculated successfully without undefined values
3. WHEN the dealing process starts for 7+ cards THEN each card SHALL have valid x, y coordinates
4. WHEN dealing animation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback to a working layout
5. WHEN 7+ cards are dealt THEN the game SHALL remain interactive and playable after dealing completes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the card game, I want the missing `adaptiveCardAreaSpacing` function to be properly implemented or replaced, so that position calculations work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `calculateCardPositions` is called THEN it SHALL NOT reference the non-existent `adaptiveCardAreaSpacing` function
2. WHEN spacing calculations are needed THEN the system SHALL use existing, working spacing functions
3. WHEN the position calculation chain executes THEN no step SHALL fail due to missing function references
4. WHEN spacing adaptation is required THEN the system SHALL use built-in spacing calculation methods
5. WHEN function reference errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the specific missing function and provide alternatives

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the card game, I want smooth and reliable position updates during window resizing, so that cards remain properly positioned when I change my browser window size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the window is resized THEN card positions SHALL be recalculated using the corrected position logic
2. WHEN resize occurs during gameplay THEN cards SHALL maintain their revealed/hidden states while updating positions
3. WHEN position recalculation happens THEN the new positions SHALL be validated before applying
4. WHEN resize causes layout changes THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and not cause visual jumps
5. WHEN resize validation fails THEN the system SHALL maintain current positions rather than applying invalid ones

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user experiencing the card game, I want consistent and reliable functionality regardless of the number of cards I choose, so that the game works smoothly for all supported quantities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any card quantity from 1-10 is selected THEN the game SHALL deal and position all cards successfully
2. WHEN position calculation errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught and handled gracefully without breaking the game
3. WHEN dealing animation starts THEN it SHALL complete successfully for all supported card quantities
4. WHEN cards are positioned THEN they SHALL all be visible and interactive regardless of quantity
5. WHEN the game encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide meaningful feedback and maintain playability
