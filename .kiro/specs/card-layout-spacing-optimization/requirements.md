# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses visual layout issues in the card flip lottery system when displaying more than 5 cards. Currently, when the quantity exceeds 5 cards, they are arranged in 2 rows (5 cards in the first row, remaining cards in the second row), but the cards are positioned too close to the container borders, creating poor visual experience. Additionally, the "剩余卡牌" (remaining cards) display may not be necessary and could be optimized or removed to improve the user interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user drawing more than 5 cards, I want the cards to have proper spacing from the container borders, so that the layout looks visually balanced and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN more than 5 cards are displayed THEN there SHALL be at least 32px spacing between the card area and the container borders on desktop
2. WHEN more than 5 cards are displayed THEN there SHALL be at least 24px spacing between the card area and the container borders on tablet
3. WHEN more than 5 cards are displayed THEN there SHALL be at least 16px spacing between the card area and the container borders on mobile
4. WHEN cards are arranged in multiple rows THEN each row SHALL be properly centered within the available space
5. WHEN the card layout is calculated THEN the spacing SHALL be consistent across all device types

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing the card layout, I want the multi-row card arrangement to be visually balanced, so that it doesn't look cramped or poorly aligned.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cards are arranged in 2 rows THEN the rows SHALL be vertically centered within the card area
2. WHEN the second row has fewer cards than the first row THEN the second row SHALL be horizontally centered
3. WHEN calculating row spacing THEN there SHALL be at least 20px vertical spacing between rows on desktop
4. WHEN calculating row spacing THEN there SHALL be at least 16px vertical spacing between rows on tablet
5. WHEN calculating row spacing THEN there SHALL be at least 12px vertical spacing between rows on mobile

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the card area to have proper margins from other UI elements, so that the interface doesn't feel cluttered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game info panel is displayed THEN there SHALL be at least 36px spacing between it and the card area on desktop
2. WHEN the game info panel is displayed THEN there SHALL be at least 32px spacing between it and the card area on tablet
3. WHEN the game info panel is displayed THEN there SHALL be at least 30px spacing between it and the card area on mobile
4. WHEN the start button is displayed THEN there SHALL be at least 24px spacing between the card area and the button
5. WHEN result information is displayed THEN there SHALL be at least 40px spacing between the card area and the result display

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand whether the "剩余卡牌" (remaining cards) display is necessary, so that the interface is clean and focused on the essential information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is in progress THEN the system SHALL evaluate if remaining cards count adds value to the user experience
2. WHEN displaying game statistics THEN only essential information SHALL be shown to avoid information overload
3. WHEN the user is focused on card flipping THEN distracting elements SHALL be minimized
4. WHEN the game is completed THEN the focus SHALL be on the results rather than remaining statistics
5. WHEN the interface is optimized THEN the remaining cards display SHALL either be removed or redesigned to be less prominent

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on different screen sizes, I want the card layout to adapt properly to available space, so that the spacing remains optimal across all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the card area margins SHALL adjust proportionally
2. WHEN the container is very wide THEN the cards SHALL not spread too far apart horizontally
3. WHEN the container is very narrow THEN the cards SHALL maintain minimum readable spacing
4. WHEN the aspect ratio changes THEN the vertical spacing SHALL adjust to maintain visual balance
5. WHEN the layout is recalculated THEN the spacing SHALL transition smoothly without jarring jumps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the card layout system, I want clear spacing configuration and validation, so that layout issues can be easily identified and fixed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN spacing is configured THEN there SHALL be clear constants for minimum spacing values
2. WHEN layout is calculated THEN the system SHALL validate that minimum spacing requirements are met
3. WHEN spacing validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback values
4. WHEN debugging layout issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed spacing information
5. WHEN spacing is adjusted THEN the changes SHALL be consistent across all related components
