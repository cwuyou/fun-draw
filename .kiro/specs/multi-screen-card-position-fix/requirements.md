# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical bug in the card flip lottery system where moving the browser window between different sized screens (e.g., from a 14-inch laptop screen to a 27-inch external monitor) causes a JavaScript error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'x')" after cards have been dealt. The error occurs because the window resize handler attempts to access card position properties that may be undefined or null during the position recalculation process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with multiple monitors, I want to be able to move the browser window between screens of different sizes without encountering JavaScript errors, so that the card lottery game continues to function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user moves the browser window from a 14-inch screen to a 27-inch screen THEN the system SHALL NOT throw "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'x')" errors
2. WHEN the user moves the browser window from a 27-inch screen to a 14-inch screen THEN the system SHALL NOT throw JavaScript errors related to position properties
3. WHEN window resize events occur during any game phase THEN the system SHALL handle undefined or null position objects gracefully
4. WHEN position recalculation fails THEN the system SHALL use fallback positioning instead of crashing
5. WHEN cards are being repositioned THEN all position properties (x, y, rotation, cardWidth, cardHeight) SHALL be validated before use

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user playing the card lottery on multiple screens, I want the cards to automatically reposition themselves correctly when I move the window between screens, so that the layout remains optimal for the new screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser window is moved to a larger screen THEN cards SHALL reposition to take advantage of the additional space
2. WHEN the browser window is moved to a smaller screen THEN cards SHALL reposition to fit within the available space
3. WHEN screen size changes THEN the card layout SHALL recalculate using the appropriate device configuration (mobile/tablet/desktop)
4. WHEN repositioning occurs THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and not cause visual jumps
5. WHEN the new layout is calculated THEN it SHALL maintain proper spacing and prevent UI element overlap

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user experiencing window resize events, I want the system to handle edge cases and error conditions gracefully, so that the game remains playable even if position calculations encounter issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN position calculation encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with fallback positioning
2. WHEN card position arrays have mismatched lengths THEN the system SHALL handle the discrepancy without crashing
3. WHEN layout calculation returns invalid results THEN the system SHALL use safe default positions
4. WHEN resize events occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL debounce the recalculation to prevent performance issues
5. WHEN position validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer debugging position-related issues, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for position calculations, so that I can identify and fix layout problems quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN position calculation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including container dimensions and card count
2. WHEN position arrays are accessed THEN the system SHALL validate array bounds before accessing elements
3. WHEN position objects are used THEN the system SHALL validate that required properties exist
4. WHEN layout debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about position calculations
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL include context information to help identify the root cause

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with cards already dealt on screen, I want the resize handling to preserve the game state while updating positions, so that I don't lose my progress when moving between screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN window resize occurs during the 'waiting' phase THEN cards SHALL maintain their revealed/hidden state
2. WHEN window resize occurs during the 'revealing' phase THEN the current flip animation SHALL complete before repositioning
3. WHEN cards are repositioned THEN the game phase SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN position updates occur THEN the card content and winner status SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN resize handling completes THEN the game SHALL be in the same interactive state as before

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user on different screen sizes, I want the position calculation system to be robust and handle various edge cases, so that the layout works correctly across all supported device types and screen configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects an ultra-wide monitor THEN it SHALL use appropriate desktop layout calculations
2. WHEN the system detects a very small screen THEN it SHALL use mobile layout with proper fallbacks
3. WHEN container dimensions are invalid THEN the system SHALL use minimum safe dimensions
4. WHEN device type detection fails THEN the system SHALL default to a safe configuration
5. WHEN layout calculation produces positions outside the safe area THEN the system SHALL adjust positions to fit within bounds
